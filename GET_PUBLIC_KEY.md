# Quick Fix: Get Your Vapi Public Key

## The Issue
Your assistant ID is configured correctly: `392feb66-378a-4852-bbea-e7fa638d4015`

But you need to add your **Public Key** to make the voice call work.

## How to Get Your Public Key

### Step 1: Go to Vapi Dashboard
1. Open https://vapi.ai in your browser
2. Log in to your account

### Step 2: Find Your Public Key
1. Click on your profile/settings (usually top right)
2. Go to **"API Keys"** or **"Settings"** → **"API Keys"**
3. Look for **"Public Key"** (it starts with `pk_`)
4. Click **"Copy"** to copy it

### Step 3: Add to Your Project
1. Open the file: `.env.local` in your project
2. Replace this line:
   ```
   VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapi_public_key_here
   ```
   
   With:
   ```
   VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_your_actual_key_here
   ```

3. Save the file

### Step 4: Restart Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Test
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Talk To Us"
3. Sevak should now greet you! 🎉

## What the Keys Do

- **Assistant ID** (`392feb66-...`): Tells Vapi which assistant to use ✅ Already configured
- **Public Key** (`pk_...`): Authenticates your app with Vapi ❌ Still needed

## Still Having Issues?

If you can't find the public key:
1. Check Vapi documentation: https://docs.vapi.ai
2. Look for "Getting Started" or "Authentication"
3. The key might be called "API Key" or "Client Key"
