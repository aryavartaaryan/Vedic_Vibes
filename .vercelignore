# Ignore heavy media from FUNCTION bundles (they are static assets served from CDN/Edge)
# Vercel automatically handles public/ folder for static serving, 
# but sometimes identifying them explicitly helps if you have specific build steps.
# However, usually 'standalone' mode solves the function size.
# We will just ensure node_modules is ignored in upload if not needed (Vercel installs it).
